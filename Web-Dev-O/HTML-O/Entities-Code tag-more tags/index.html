    <h1>Character sets and meta tags:</h1>
    <h2>Character sets:</h2>
    <p>
      A character set maps numbers to characters so computers can display text properly. Modern webpages use UTF-8, which supports all languages, symbols, and emojis. Itâ€™s efficient and widely adopted.These are attributes used inside meta tags !
    </p>
    <h2>Meta tags</h2>
    <p>
      Meta tags provide metadata (information about the webpage) to browsers and search engines. They are placed inside the &lt;head&gt; of an HTML document and do not appear on the page itself.
