        <!--Svgs can be programmed in two ways,
         first is: writing the code itself-->
        <svg height="100" width="100">
            <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="50" stroke="black" stroke-width="3" fill="red" />
            <!-- the cx attribute defines where your image should be horizontally if you increase the value then the image will move more to the right and vice versa, the cy attribute defines where your image should be vertically if you increase the value it will move more to the bottom and if you decrease it will move more to the top, r means radius which is basically he radius of he circle if you increase it then the size of circle will also increase the r attribute depends upon which type of shape u are using if it isnt a circle then r attribute wont be used!, the stroke attribute is the border line and stroke width defines how thick the border should be and fill just fills a color in entire shape  -->
        </svg>
        <!-- second is: using img tag-->
        <img src="img.svg" alt="sample image">
