    <h1>List of selector types:</h1>
    <ol type="i">
        <li>Universal Selectors</li>
        <li>Element Selectors</li>
        <li>ID Selectors</li>
        <li>Class Selectors</li>
        <li>Group Selectors</li>
        <li>Pseudo Selectors</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Universal Selectors :</h1>
    <p>
        Universal selector is a type of selector that targets all the elements in the code meaning that any property
        applied to it will take effect on all the elements present in the code, see its syntax in the style.css file !
    </p>

    <h1>Element Selectors :</h1>
    <p>
        Element selector is a type of selector in which we style only a specific selector rather than the whole html
        webpage like we did in universal selector, properties can be applied to it using the respected element name as i
        am going to apply a background color 'aquamarine' to 'h1' so that every h1 tag in this html file will be
        affected by this and no other tag except h1 will get affected !
    </p>

    <h1 id="id_selector">ID Selectors :</h1>
    <p>
        An ID selector is unique selector that specifies css effects to a specific html element associated with the
        respected ID only.Also one ID can only be used for one tag more than one tags cant have same ID, due to the ID
        selector this H1's background color will differ from the rest despite the element selector's properties.
    </p>

    <h1>Class Selectors :</h1>
    <p class="class_selector">
        Class selector is just like ID selector but it can be used to target multiple specifc elements rather than just
        a single element like in ID selector.
    </p>
    <p class="class_selector">
        Like I am going to assign these two paragraph's font color to . so you can notice that only the font color of
        these two paragraphs has changed and the color of rest of the &lt;p&gt; tags are not changed.
    </p>

    <h1>Group Selector :</h1>
    <p>
        A group selector works like class selector but it doesnot specify a element and outcast it interms of properties
        from others but using this we can save alot of time.I will use a anchor and &lt;q&gt; tag for demonstration.
    </p>
    <div>An apple.</div>
    <div><q>When nothing change, nothing changes.</q></div>

    <h1>Pseudo classes</h1>
    <p>
        Definition: CSS rules that target an element based on its state or condition.
        Explanation: Imagine you have a button. A pseudo-class allows you to apply specific styles to that button only
        when certain conditions are met. For example, the :hover pseudo-class applies styles when the mouse hovers over
        the button, making it appear different to the user. I will use different elements for demonstration of different tyoe of
        pseudo-classes.
