        <h3>○ Hex notation :</h3>
        <p>The hex code consists of a hash(#) symbol followed by six characters. These six characters are arranged into a set of three pairs (RR, GG, and BB).
            Each character pair defines the intensity level of the colour, where R stands for red, G stands for green, and B stands for blue.
            The intensity value lies between 00 (no intensity) and ff (maximum intensity).
            Breaking the Character Set (RRGGBB):
           <p>
            <ul>
                <li>RR: RR defines the intensity of color red, ranging from 00 (no red) to FF (maximum red).</li>
                <li>GG: GG defines the intensity of color Green, with values from 00 (no green) to FF (full green).</li>
                <li>BB: GG defines the intensity of color Blue, varying from 00 (no blue) to FF (full blue).</li>
            </ul>
          </p>  
        </p>
        <h3>Example :</h3>
        <p id="hex">This is a color assigned using hex notation.</p>      
    </div>
    
    <div class="container">
        <h3>○ rgb and rgba :</h3>
        <p>RGB stands for Red, Green, and Blue. It is a color model that defines the intensity of red, green, and blue colors in a color. 
            The intensity value lies between 0 to 255. The RGB color model is an additive color model in which red, green, and blue light are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colors.
            The RGB color model is based on the three primary colors of light: red, green, and blue. These three colors are combined in various ways to produce other colors.</p>
        <p>RGBA is just like rgb but with a additional alpha value which defines the opacity of the color.</p>
        <h3>Example of rgb:</h3>
        <p id="rgb">This is a rgb color.</p>
        <h3>Example of rgba:</h3>
        <p id="rgba">This is a rgba color.</p>
    </div>
     
    <div class="container">
        <h3>○ hsl and hsla :</h3>
        <p>HSL stands for Hue, Saturation, and Lightness. It is a color model that defines the intensity of hue, saturation, and lightness in a color. 
            The intensity value lies between 0 to 360 for hue, 0% to 100% for saturation and lightness.
            The HSL color model is based on the three primary colors of light: hue, saturation, and lightness. These three colors are combined in various ways to produce other colors.</p>
        <p>HSLA is just like hsl but with a additional alpha value which defines the opacity of the color.</p>
        <h3>Example of hsl:</h3>
        <p id="hsl">This is an example of hsl color.</p>
        <h3>Example of hsla:</h3>
        <p id="hsla">This is an example of hsla color.</p>
    </div>
